                <p> <br> Welcome to my page! Get ready to be completely uninpressed with my very normal life and interests.
                <br><br>
                 Hi. Call me <b>Ricci</b>.<br><br>
                   I was born in one particular dry city in Brazil called Brasília, also known as the capital of the country.
                   I've only ever lived in two other places. The details are in the <a href="">Travels</a> page.
                </p>
                <p>Currently 21 y.o. and... well. I look like this -> <img > <br>
                   Legends say there's a gallery with pictures at the end of this page but I'm too lazy to check.</p>
                
              </section>
              <section id="academic-life">
                <h2><span id="academic-title"></span>Academic Life</h2>
                <p>I study Control and Automation Engineering at the <a href="https://international.unb.br">University of Brasília<a>. The course itself has a <i>lot</i>
                of content. That is because the way this course is handled in my country is basically a mix of Electrical and Mechanical
                Engineering plus Computer Science. So yeah, we have to cover a lot. Due to this, the course has a flexible work load per semester.
                The only requirement is that we must finish in a period from 5 to 10 years. Currently, I'm in my 6th year.
                <br>
                There are different reasons why people take longer to graduate. In my case, during my sixth semester I took two
                simultaneous internships, which totaled at 32 work hours per week. So I took a smaller academic work load for one year to
                compensate. But that doesn't mean that in this period I stalled academically. Here is a couple of things I have accomplished in
                this scenario:</p>
                
                <dl>
                  <dt>Tutoring
                  <dd>Universities are spaces that provide a lot of interaction between people that are in different 
                    steps in their courses. It isn't uncommon for universities in Brazil to create resources to provide
                    more interaction between newcomers and their seniors. Some of the more difficult courses have special
                    tutoring programs, in which people who already passed the course are hired to help new students with their
                    projects and questions they might have.
                    I worked as a tutor in the course "Algorithms and Computer Programming". This is the first programming course in
                    all computer-related courses.
                  
                  <dt>Research project
                  <dd> 
                    <div class="midtext-img"><figure><img src="pictures/Robot1.jpeg" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 15%;" alt="real robot"><figcaption style="width: 190px;">Fig 1. Robot manipulator in rest position</figcaption></figure>
                    <figure><img src="pictures/Robot2.jpeg" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 15%;" alt="real robot"><figcaption style="width: 190px;">Fig 2. Virtual visualization of robot movement in software</figcaption></figure></div> 
                    My first research project was related to Industrial Robotics.
                    In the mechanics lab there sat a very lonely robot from the 90s called ABB IRB 2000, because
                    its main control board got fried. So the proposal was to retrofit the robot using a more modern
                    direct-to-PC control architecture that allowed for GCode input, with LinuxCNC. 
                
                  <dt>Brasília's Open Laboratory (LAB)
                  <dd> This is a multi-course laboratory in which the purpose is to
                    train students to work in the industry as Engineers. The focus is on helping
                    students learn to work on a multidisciplinary setting on engineering projects.
                    These projects are developed by request of either enterprises whose objective is to
                    solve real world problems, or the academic community itself. In order to provide solutions,
                    we work with fast prototyping technologies, such as 3D printing, lasercutting and 3D scanning.
                    Thus, in this space we function much like a real company, with an operations team and a management team, client meetings,
                    maintenance schedule (which is performed by the students themselves) and project management timelines.
                    As part of the operations team, my tasks ranged from designing the solution itself through CAE and CAD software,
                    as well as work and troubleshoot the machines. Over the months, I got a lot of experience with maintenance of
                    3D printing systems in many configurations. There are some cool things in the <a href="#gallery-title">Gallery</a>, so feel free 
                    to check them out.

                <p>In the meantime, I'd like to talk about other things I have worked with, such as platforms I use.
                  First things first, I don't use social media except for when I am absolutely obligated to 
                  do so (school, jobs, linked accounts). Thankfully there's <a href="index.html">this very nifty website</a> with all the details
